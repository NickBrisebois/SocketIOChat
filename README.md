# SocketIOChat

This is a very basic chat app written in NodeJS and SocketIO

To start the server open the server folder and type the following:

     $ npm install
  
     $ npm start

The client is written to start on port 80 so you must run it with sudo:

     $ npm instal
  
     $ sudo node index.js
